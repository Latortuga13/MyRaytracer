Hi! This is Seth Chng's Raytracer. He coded it up from scratch.

if you want to compile and create an image using the raytracer run the following command

g++  main.cpp readfile.cpp transform.cpp -o main.exe -L. -lFreeImage

then run  
./main.exe scene(whatevernumber).test scene(whatevernumber).png

the output will be in scene(whatevernumber).png.

code was made on windows.
